# About Sky Scanner App
This project was created for the Capital One software engineering summit. 
It utilizes the Skyscanner Flight Search API to get its results

## How to use
Most instructions here are also iterated in the instruction paragraph on the webpage.
To get started, click the blue 'here' text in the middle of the instructions paragraph.
That should launch a popup window asking for user input to pull up airport results for 
a given destination. Type in whatever city you're leaving from or going to. Capitilization
does not matter for the search to work properly, but you should try to spell city names
as accurately as possible. A table should pop up with names of airports around the input city,
select whichever one you want. Repeat this process for the destination city if so needed. 
Pick the dates for your trip and click view rates to, well, view rates.

## Default Values:

### Dates
If no date is selected for either 'Departing' or 'Returning' their values default to 'anytime.'
